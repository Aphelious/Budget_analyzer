##Budget Utility

---

###Objective:

This application is designed to show clear visualizations of personal 
finance data, accepting .xlsx or .csv files as input. First, input data is 
parsed, either using standard Python functionality or NLP techniques,
to convert the often obtuse transaction descriptions given by banking
software to something that makes ore sense to the user. The model will
learn to categorize the transaction descriptions into more useful and 
recognizable entries and this model will persist for the user to benefit
from in the future. A series of operations is then performed to analyze 
the transactions and generate the necessary descriptive statistics of 
the banking transactions. The application then calls on a suite of 
sophisticated visualization tools to produce clear and interesting graphs
that explain the user's personal financial behavior in ways that empower
them to make changes if they choose to do so.
